# pet-adoption-backend
Welcome to my pet adoption project backend! 

I worked on this pet adoption website as my last project at ITC.

Here is a short demo of my project: 

As you can see, I only have one commit for this project, I do have a separate repo for the commited version but due to me learning git during this project,
I wasn't aware of the safety problems and didn't put my .env in the gitignore. 

Enjoy!
