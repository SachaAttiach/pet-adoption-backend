# pet-adoption-backend
Welcome to my pet adoption project backend! 

I worked on this pet adoption website as my last project at ITC.

I used the MERN stack (mongo, express, react and node)

Here is a short demo of my project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2aFi1kyT-g&ab_channel=Sacha

As you can see, I only have one commit for this project, I do have a separate repo for the commited version but due to me learning git during this project,
I wasn't aware of the safety problems and didn't put my .env in the gitignore. 

Enjoy!
